# Docs  
Not available yet  
  
# Features:  
 - Routes with very simple JSON objects  
 - Disables `x-powered-by` header by default  
 - Already `.use()`s `express.json()` for out-of-the-box request body JSON deserialisation  
 - Access to the Express server object  
 - Probably more coming!  
  
# Notes:  
 - The framework is in development right now, it will exit beta once the first NPM package is posted (named `koolpress`)
